 * Options for scheduling issues with remaining effort or wait time.
 *
 * It’s important to distinguish:
 * - Elapsed time (aka duration). [Cohn (2006, “Agile Estimating and Planning”)](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/935197594)
 *   defines this as “the amount of time that passes on a clock (or perhaps a calendar).”
 * - Ideal time (aka effort or work). This, in contrast, is the “amount of time that something takes when stripped of
 *   all peripheral activities” (ibid.). Ideal time also does not contain time off work (such as nights or weekend).
 *
 * It is further important to define whether a quantity is given relative to the:
 * - actual work time of a contributor (say, 20h/week in case of part-time),
 * - regular work time (say, 40h/week), or
 * - real time (aka elapsed or wall-clock time; that is, 7 * 24h/week).
 *
 * In practice, this usually only affects the conversion factors between hours and days (say, 8h/d or 24h/d), and
 * between days and weeks (say, 5d/week vs. 7d/week).
 *
 * Finally, there are different options for mapping from work time to real time:
 * - Using the contributors’s work schedule (say, Monday through Friday, between 9am and 5pm) as a step function. No
 *   activity is scheduled outside these time windows.
 * - Interpolation. Here, the simplified assumption is that work time is evenly distributed over the entire real week.
 *   While this choice is arguably less realistic, it has the benefit of simplicity, and is often still sufficient for
 *   estimation purposes.
 *
 * In this module, in the absence of further qualification, elapsed time is meant relative to real time (24h/d and
 * 7d/week), and ideal time is meant relative to regular work time (which is
 * [configurable in YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/standalone/resource-api-admin-timeTrackingSettings-workTimeSettings.html)).
 * This module uses interpolation to convert from work time to real time. (The ceiling function is used for any integer
 * conversion.)
